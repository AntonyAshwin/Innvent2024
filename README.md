Hi All,

This is my InnVent for Scholars 2024 project.
An excel process in python to find the maximum profit that a store can make and the optimal space allocation within a shelf.
This is a pure excel function based projects written in python. The hackathon was themed around "AI", but sometimes... not all problems need AI.
We were given this problem statement, the expected solution, the tech stack, the existing data. Best we could do haha :)

Best Regards,
Ashwin
